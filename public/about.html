<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Currently I am a student at CSULB pursuing my Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science.
  One day I'm hoping to be a cybersecurity specialist working on protecting people's information.

<p>In my free time I like to play sports, go to the gym, ride my skateboard and play video 
  games. I also enjoy playing with and walking my dogs, as well as watching probably too 
  many youtube videos.
